C-Star Engine
==============================
C-Star engine is a windows emulator for [Chaotron 8](https://github.com/garys-primary/AVR/tree/master/chaotron_8) synthesizer.

The engine runs the synth logic 1:1, as if it is uploaded to AVR part.
This allows faster development, debugging and monitoring compared to uploading directly into AVR. 
It also saves AVR write cycles. The knobs and buttons are mapped to keyboard keys with configurable step.

C-Star engine works well with Virtual Cable, which allows connecting a virtual osciloscope to synthesizer's parallel outputs.
